# Dell XPS15 9520 Linux

At this time/point, this Repo is simply notes, anecdotes, etc.. of installing Linux on a my Dell XPS15.  

My XPS was shipped with a single 1TB NVM with Windows 11 installed.  I firstly booted and configured Windows 11 before I break everything.  
Once the system was running, I installed the 2nd 1TB drive.  (For the record:  rremoving the bottom cover was kind of a pain).

TL;DR:  The Dell XPS 15 9520 (2022) with 4k touch screen seems to run well with Fedora 37.
